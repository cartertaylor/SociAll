*Group Members: Carter Taylor, Ethan Baranowski, Dakota Battle, Liam Scholl, Max Mosier, Quinn Melssen, William Fuertes*

## 1. Introduction
With there being more and more social media websites that people can interact in, the need to link all of these social media accounts to one location has arisen. SociAll is designed to create this single location so that a person can link all of their social media accounts. Users will be able to create a profile with SociAll where they will be able to link any social media profile that they have. The users will then be able to add a person on all of their linked social media acocunts simply by adding/following someones SociAll account. Future additions may include things like: a QR reader so that people can easily add/follow someone on SociAll, a feature to un-add/un-follow someone on SociAll, a way to view someones linked social media accounts so people like employers could easily see an applicants social medias in one location, and a way to have a social media setting and a business setting for your profile.

## 2. Initial value proposition and consumer segments
IVP:
SociAll is going to be a free application that is designed for people to easily add someone else on all applicable social media accounts.

Initial Consumer Segements:
- Anyone who uses social media.
- Employers looking to view applicants social media pages

## 3. Interviews summary

### Interview 1:

**Summary:** Gia Neve found that SociAll would mostly be used in a business marketing sense, but has potential in a laidback social setting. She had many ideas
and contributions to potential features, finding that it would be most useful to have dedicated settings for non-professional and professional profiles/engagement capabilities.

**Interviewer:** Ethan Baranowski

**Interviewee:** Gia Neve

**When:** 02/05/2021

**Consumer Segments:**

**Key insights:** Believes that two separate settings for buisness settings and social settings should be implemented. Gia states that she
 would not post anything important to Facebook or Twitter unless it was for business purposes. Concerns around formatting for each media site also
 brought concern. She also believed that in a "non-professional" setting, multiple posting abilities would be nice to have. In addition, she was in favor
 of extra security and password storing but was confused on the functionailty of it. (Had thoughts on in-app encrypted key operations)

**Representative quotes:** "I believe the app has a lot of potential for increasing traffic for businesses, but also easing the efforts of connecting with friends in a public setting"

**Assessment: (Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care):** Gia thought this app would be "nice to have", but a "must have" in for marketing focused individuals.

### Interview 2:

**Summary:** This would not be the most useful for Skyeler becasue he does not use Social media. But he does use social media like Reddit, or if there would be some way to connect it to video game accounts. Thinks an extension of accounts could make it even more popular

**Interviewer:** Carter Taylor

**Interviewee:** Skyeler Moody

**When:** 2/6/21

**Consumer Segments:**

**Key insights:** Slyeler would if you could connect your other media accounts (disney plus, netflix, hulu, etc...) in order to broaden the market audience. Additionally as a gamer, he would really like if there was a way for him to connect to his friends video game accounts

**Representative quotes** "If I could find an easy way to find my friends on video games, I would love that"

**Assessment: (Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care)** For Skyeler, if it had all his steaming and game stuff, it would be a must have.

### Interview 3:

**Summary:** If it was a password manager, Jess would prefer not to be using that feature. Jess would want to make sure that there is some good security in the case where someone might be able to get into your accounts. But Jess also thinks that it could be expanded even more if there was a way for you to connect streaming platforms to it.

**Interviewer:** Carter Taylor

**Interviewee:** Jess

**When:** 2/6/2021

**Consumer Segments:**

**Key insights** Jess could see another use by having steaming platforms connected in addition to the social media accounts.

**Interviewer:** William Fuertes

**Interviewee:** Jose Raya

**When:** 2/6/2021

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care** Nice to have especially for influencers or people that in the higher hierarchy.

### Interview 5:

**Summary:** Paige thought that SociAll is a good idea. She believes that their is a need for it so that it would work to make it. She thought that the app would be a matter of convenience so that it is easier to add one person on all social media.

**Interviewer:** Max Mosier

**Interviewee:** Paige Thowson

**When:** 2/6/2021

**Consumer Segments:**
- Anyone with two or more social media accounts.
- Employers (If there was a search for person feature).

**Key insights** It would be really convenient to be able to add someone in one location instead of many. This is because you only have to add one username when a person could have different usernames for each social media.

**Representative quotes** "Convenience is nice." - Paige

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care** Nice to have. They don't think its a must have app, but convenience is really nice.

### Interview 6:

**Summary:** Stephen personally saw no use for SociAll. He only uses Facebook and he very rarely adds new people. He also has a LinkedIn which could be used be he would want to keep work and social seperate.

**Interviewer:** Max Mosier

**Interviewee:** Stephen Williams

**When:** 2/6/2021

**Consumer Segments:**
- Anyone with two or more social media accounts.
- Employers (If there was a search for person feature).

**Representative quotes**

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care** Don't care. Stephen doesn't really care about the concept of SociAll because he doesn't use it enough.

### Interview 7:

**Summary:** Brendan thought that the idea itself was good, but perticularly felt as though he would use the text chat portion of things for meeeting new people. He was not sure if he would sign up, but liked the idea of being able to find other people who had decided to. He encouraged us to look for more incentives to get people to sign up in the first place.

**Interviewer:** Quinn Melssen

**Interviewee:** Brendan Mellady

**When:** 2/6/2021

**Consumer Segments:**

**Key insights** -Needs incentive to sign up in the first place, or functionality where you don't have to.

**Representative quotes** "Finding someone's profiles all at once could make adding people a lot easier."

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care** Nice to have

### Interview 8:

**Summary:** Lexi thought that this was a great idea! She is the VP of a political marketing company and thought that being able to push ONE social media keychain, as opposed to 8 different social media accounts, would make her life a lot easier in her work. She also does a lot of hiring and likes the idea of being able to look people up and see all their various social medias in one place, but was wary that some people wouldn't necessarily want that.

**Interviewer:** Quinn Melssen

**Interviewee:** Alexi Melssen

**When:** 2/7/2021

**Consumer Segments:**

**Key insights** -Needs an option to hide certain accounts for those that don't want everything on their account displaye

**Representative quotes** "I'm not sure everyone wants their LinkedIn directly next to their Instagram"

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care** Must Have

### Interview 9:

**Summary:** Heather thought this was an okay idea. She said that it is a decent product if used for professional reasons, but it could lead to dangerous outcomes if it's abused. For example, for jobs, it's good because an employer can look at all social medias of an employee at ease. It can be dangerous if someone uses it to heavily stalk someone or even take someone's identity. How would a user be verified to be that person? Any person could make an account and say that they are anybody else. There should be some verification process, which can be tedious.

**Interviewer:** Liam Scholl

**Interviewee:** Heather Zajac

**When:** 02/10/2021

**Consumer Segments:** Employers, Social Media Models (for publicity), anyone that has a lot of social media accounts.

**Key insights** Possibly have a log of who has looked at your account, if they have an account.

**Representative quotes** "Anyone could access all of your social media at anytime and exacerbate the internet stalking issue."

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care** Don't care, but thinks people would use it.

### Interview 10:

**Summary:** Andrew did not believe SociAll was an idea that he would make use of. His primary concern was that of security; he does not want all of his information from each platform to be readily available in any one location. He made it very clear that he would not want to use anything of the sort if it involved him storing his login credentials. If he were certain that SociAll did not store any credentials, he can understand the convenience of the concept.

**Interviewer:** Dakota Battle

**Interviewee:** Andrew Gonzalez

**When:** 2/7/2021

**Consumer Segments:**

**Key insights:** Andrew is unwilling to store his credentials for social media platforms anywhere. He would only use the app if he didn’t have to do this.

**Representative quotes:** “If you get hacked on this site, you get hacked on everything.”

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care** Andrew felt this app would be nice to have, but only under the condition that his credentials weren’t stored by it.

### Interview 11:

**Summary:** Maureen expressed her frustration with finding friends on different platforms since their usernames aren’t always the same. She was very interested in being able to locate friends without asking them over and over what their usernames are on each platform.

**Interviewer:** Dakota Battle

**Interviewee:** Maureen Dawson

**When:** 2/7/2021

**Consumer Segments:**

**Key insights:** Maureen believes that this app would save time when looking for friends and family on different platforms. This precise problem has made her reluctant to register for anymore social media platforms than she already has, and SociAll’s value would change that.

**Representative quotes:** “I wouldn’t have to type people’s names fifteen different ways to find them on Instagram.”

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care** This application is a must have for Maureen because she regularly spends time looking for friends on different platforms.
